excerpt: 'Trajectory prediction methods often operate under the assumption that observed trajectory waypoint sequences are complete, disregarding real-world scenarios where missing values may occur, which can influence their performance. Moreover, these models frequently exhibit a bias towards particular waypoint sequences when making predictions. Our TWD is capable of effectively addressing these issues.'

Trajectory prediction methods often operate under the assumption that observed trajectory waypoint sequences are complete, disregarding real-world scenarios where missing values may occur, which can influence their performance. Moreover, these models frequently exhibit a bias towards particular waypoint sequences when making predictions. Our TWD is capable of effectively addressing these issues.
