Trajectory prediction methods often operate under the assumption that observed trajectory waypoint sequences are complete, disregarding real-world scenarios where missing values may occur, which can influence their performance. Moreover, these models frequently exhibit a bias towards particular waypoint sequences when making predictions. Our TWD is capable of effectively addressing these issues.
