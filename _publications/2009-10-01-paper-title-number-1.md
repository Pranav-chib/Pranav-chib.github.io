End-to-end autonomous driving is a promising paradigm as it circumvents the drawbacks associated with modular systems, such as their overwhelming complexity and propensity for error propagation. Autonomous driving transcends conventional traffic patterns by proactively recognizing critical events in advance, ensuring passengers’ safety and providing them with comfortable transportation, particularly in highly stochastic and variable traffic settings.
