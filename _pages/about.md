I am a 2st Year Ph.D. student (advised by Professor Pravendra Singh) in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Roorkee. I worked with the same advisor during my undergrad years as a part of SHI Labs. I earned my Master's in Computer Science and Technology From School of Computer and Systems Sciences JNU, New Delhi in 2022.

My current research interests broadly revolve arounds machine learning, computer vision, and autonomous driving. My ongoing doctoral studies focus on contributing to advancements in autonomous driving and deep learning.
